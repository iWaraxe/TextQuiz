## Introduction to Your First Project: A Simple Text-based Quiz Game

### **A. Project Overview**

**Objective:** Your task is to build a text-based quiz game using what we've learned in class, like loops and conditional statements. Here's what you'll create:

1. **Ask at least five multiple-choice questions.**
2. **Keep track of the user's score.**
3. **Tell them 'Correct!' or 'Try again!' based on their answers.**

It's like hosting a mini-game show on your computer!

### **B. Getting Started**

I'll share example code and helpful resources in our online classroom. Check there if you need help!

### **C. Submission Details**

**Deadline:** Next Friday, before our next class.
**How to Submit:** You'll send your code through GitHub Classroom. Don't forget to add comments in your code.

## **Project Details!**

### **A. Introduction**

You'll make a quiz game in the console. It'll ask multiple-choice questions and give a score at the end. Feel free to get creative with your questions!

Here's a quick look at what your game might include:

1. **Welcome Screen:** "Welcome to the Java Quiz Game!"
2. **Questions:** Show multiple-choice questions with four options.
3. **Answers:** Users pick their answer.
4. **Feedback:** Let them know if they were right or wrong.
5. **Final Score:** Show their correct answers at the end.

### **B. What You Need to Do**

1. **Questions:** Have at least ten multiple-choice questions.
2. **User Interface:** Guide the user with clear instructions.
3. **Check Answers:** Make sure the user's answers are valid.
4. **Track Score:** Keep count of correct answers.
5. **Organize Your Code:** Use comments and functions to keep things neat.
6. **Add Extras (Optional):** Categories? Difficulty levels? Time limits? Up to you!
7. **How to Send Your Project:** You'll find out how to submit it through GitHub as the deadline gets closer.

### **C. Grading**

Here's what I'll be looking at when grading:

1. **Functionality (40%):** Does everything work as it should?
2. **Code Quality (30%):** Is your code clean and easy to understand?
3. **User Experience (15%):** Is it easy and fun for someone to play your game?
4. **Creativity (10%):** Did you add something unique to your project?
5. **Documentation (5%):** Is there a guide that explains how your game works?
